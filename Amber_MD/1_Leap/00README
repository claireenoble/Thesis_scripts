Scripts for carrying out tleap processing of input pdbs.

1 - prep_leap.sh

In this example PDBs must be named *initial.pdb to be recognised by this script.
Renames the histidines and hemes at specified locations to the HIN/HIM and HEB names required for amber.
Uses the AmberTools reduce and pdb4amber functions to remove all non-Amber naming convention hydrogens, and prepare for leap.

The output file is named *_input.pdb

2 - write_leap.sh

PDBs named *_input.pdb will be recognised by this script.
Writes input leap files for individual proteins. In this example, the heme is at position 197 and the coordinating histidines are at residues 9 and 109.
The script defines the orbital hybridisation for the heme Fe and NO/NP atoms to prevent sp0 errors in tleap.

3 - run_leap.sh

Runs all of the written tleap input files for each of the structures. Leads to production of inpcrd and prmtop files for production MD, plus a reference PDB file called *tleap.pdb for manual checking of the solvation/ions.

4 - example_tleap.in
