Heme parameters and forcefield modifications used in various simulations

****** HemeB.frcmod with HemeB.mol2 ******

All-atom parameters for a 6-coordinate heme with no ligands included. The mol2 file was converted from the deprecated .prep format heme_all.in file available as standard in AmberTools. This parameter was used for simulation of 5-coordinate histidine containing systems, as more appropriate parameters for a heme with a single histidine ligand could not be found.

****** Cyx_HemeB.frcmod with Cyx_HemeB.lib ******

Used for the 5-coordinate cysteine ligated hemes, in conjunction with standard CYX.lib parameters for deprotonated cysteine. 

Taken from Ferric-high-spin.frcmod- Shahrokh,K; Orendt,A; Yost, G.S; and Cheatham III, T.E. Jour Comp Chem (2011).

****** His_HemeB.frcmod with His_HemeB.lib ******

Used for 6-coordinate, bis-histidine ligated hemes. Parameters include the coordinating histidines, which must be renamed to HIN and HIM in the PDB file (see tleap scripts) for these parameters to work.
Taken from Yang, Longhua, et al. "Data for molecular dynamics simulations of B-type cytochrome c oxidase with the Amber force field." Data in brief 8 (2016): 1209-1214.
